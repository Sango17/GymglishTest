# GymglishTest

### Task given by Gymglish
I have to write a small Android app. It should start with a Login screen (no need to make a real request, I can check the login/password locally).

Once the user is logged in, a list of some of websites should be available: www.gymglish.com, www.frantastique.com and, www.vatefaireconjuguer.com

Ultimately, when selecting a website, the WebView should load the selected URL. The user should be able to navigate between those different screens (Login, List and Webview) with the back button of the mobile phone as well. This back button should always take the user to the previous logical state of the app, and not the last visited state.
